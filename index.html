            <p>
              After completing culinary school, I moved to Spain to further
              develop my skills and immerse myself in the country’s rich food
              culture. During my time there, I honed my craft and developed a
              deep appreciation for Spanish ingredients, seasonality, and bold
              yet simple flavors that continue to influence my cooking style
              today. I later returned to England to join Sticky Walnut, which
              had just been awarded AA Restaurant of the Year. Working in such a
              high-performing and ambitious kitchen environment pushed me to
              grow quickly, and through dedication and consistency, I progressed
              to become Head Chef at the age of 22. Following this achievement,
              I moved to Manchester to support a new opening within the same
              restaurant group, helping to establish standards, build the team,
              and maintain the group’s award-winning reputation. During my time
              with Elite Bistros, I was involved in numerous high-profile events
              across England, including the prestigious Obsession at Northcote.
              During my career I had the privilege of working alongside renowned
              chefs such as Michel Roux, Angela Hartnett, and Tom Kerridge to
              name a few. Experiences that further refined my skill and
              commitment to excellence.
