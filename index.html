            <p>
              After completing culinary school, I moved to Spain to further
              develop my skills and immerse myself in the country’s rich food
              culture. During my time there, I honed my craft and developed a
              deep appreciation for Spanish ingredients, seasonality, and bold
              yet simple flavors that continue to influence my cooking style
              today. I later returned to England to join Sticky Walnut, which
              had just been awarded AA Restaurant of the Year. Working in such a
              high-performing and ambitious kitchen environment pushed me to
              grow quickly, and through dedication and consistency, I progressed
              to become Head Chef at the age of 22. Following this achievement,
              I moved to Manchester to support a new opening within the same
              restaurant group, helping to establish standards, build the team,
              and maintain the group’s award-winning reputation. During my time
              with Elite Bistros, I was involved in numerous high-profile events
              across England, including the prestigious Obsession at Northcote.
              During my career I had the privilege of working alongside renowned
              chefs such as Michel Roux, Angela Hartnett, and Tom Kerridge to
              name a few. Experiences that further refined my skill and
              commitment to excellence.

            <p>
              I began my career in 2016. After qualifying, I moved to Chester to
              join Edgar House, a renowned boutique hotel. It was here that I
              refined my classical technique and developed a deeper appreciation
              for ingredient-led cooking. From there, I joined Sticky Walnut, an
              ambitious and demanding kitchen that truly shaped me as a chef.
              The pressure was intense, but it moulded my approach, discipline
              and creativity. It holds personal significance, as it's where I
              first met Jack. Over the years, I progressed from sous chef to
              head chef, taking on wider management roles across the company and
              strengthening my leadership skills. I’m currently Head Chef at
              Hispi, Manchester. Throughout my career, I’ve developed a style
              rooted in exceptional produce, thoughtful composition and bold,
              balanced flavours - always putting taste at the forefront of every
              dish. Alongside Jack, I bring years of experience and a deep,
              shared understanding of food. We work in harmony, combining
              creativity with precision to deliver memorable dining experiences.
              I’ve been fortunate to work with and learn from some truly
              inspiring chefs, including Phil Howard, Tom Aikens & Callum
              Franklin - experiences that have stayed with me since the very
              beginning of my journey in the kitchen. For private dining, my
              focus is simple: exceptional ingredients, confident cooking, and
              dishes designed to bring people together around the table.
